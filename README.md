# ChessTube Analyzer

A C++ project to analyze chess videos and extract game data, including moves, positions, and timestamps.

## Overview

This tool processes chess video files, identifies board states, and reconstructs the game played. The pipeline is purely visual — it uses the chess.com UI itself (highlights, clocks, arrows) as an absolute state machine to achieve high accuracy.

## Features

- **Video Processing**: Extract chess moves from video files using computer vision
- **Move Verification**: Legal move validation using libchess engine
- **UI Detection**: Automatic detection of yellow highlights, arrows, clocks, and hover boxes
- **Clock Recognition**: Hu Moments-based OCR for clock time extraction
- **PGN Export**: Generate PGN files with extracted moves, clock information, and analysis variations.
- **Stockfish Analysis**: Optional engine analysis with configurable MultiPV, search depth, and engine variation length. The application can auto-find your Stockfish executable or you can specify a path.
- **Custom Output**: Save analysis alongside the source video or in a custom directory (defaults to your Documents folder).
- **Channel-Specific Templates**: Auto-detect and apply custom visual overlay layouts tailored for different chess YouTube channels via a built-in screenshot-based template editor.
- **Analysis Video Generation**: Option to generate an analysis video with a synchronized board overlay, evaluation bar, dynamic best move arrows (scaled by evaluation strength), and engine evaluation lines.
- **GUI Application**: Qt6-based GUI with universal theme system (Light/Dark/System mode)

## Quick Start

### Windows Installer (Recommended)
Download and run the latest NSIS installer from the Releases page. The application stores configuration in `%APPDATA%\ChessTubeAnalyzer`, including overlay templates in `%APPDATA%\ChessTubeAnalyzer\templates`, and exports generated files to your `Documents` folder by default to avoid write-permission errors.

### Developer Build
```cmd
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=E:/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake -DVCPKG_TARGET_TRIPLET=x64-windows-static
cmake --build build --config Release
```

> **Note:** Use `x64-windows-static` (not `x64-windows`) to enable static linking and LTO, which eliminates DLL dispatch overhead and allows Whole Program Optimization.

#### Optional GPU Acceleration

The project includes a GPU acceleration layer (`GPUAccelerator` + `GPUPipeline`) that uses NVIDIA NPP directly from your system CUDA SDK — **no OpenCV rebuild needed**.

To enable:

1. Install the [CUDA Toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads) (includes NPP runtime DLLs like `nppial64_13.dll`, `nppicc64_13.dll`, etc.)
2. CMake auto-detects CUDA at `C:/Program Files/NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit/CUDA/v13.2`
3. Rebuild — NPP ops will be compiled in and used at runtime

When CUDA runtime DLLs are not installed, the binary still runs — `GPUAccelerator::init()` checks for DLL existence before attempting GPU ops, falling back to CPU seamlessly.

### Run

**GUI (Recommended):**
```cmd
cd build\Release
"ChessTube Analyzer.exe"
```

**CLI Mode:**
```cmd
cd build\Release
"ChessTube Analyzer.exe" "path\to\video1.mp4;path\to\video2.mp4" --board-asset "path\to\board.png"
```

### Test
```cmd
cd cpp\build\Release
test_extract_moves.exe
```

See `TODO.md` for the full list of tests and how to toggle them.

## Runtime Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| FFmpeg | Required for analysis video generation to composite overlays and mux audio into the final MP4. Must be available in the system's PATH. |

## Dependencies

All dependencies are managed via vcpkg on `E:\vcpkg`:

| Dependency | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| OpenCV 4.12 | Image processing, video I/O |
| nlohmann-json | JSON output |
| CLI11 | CLI argument parsing |
| libchess (E:\libchess) | Legal move generation, FEN I/O |
| Google Test | Unit testing |
| qtbase | Qt6 Core GUI framework |

**Removed dependencies:** Tesseract — replaced with a lightweight Hu Moments-based digit recognizer (zero external dependencies, runs in microseconds).

## Test Control Panel

All tests live in `tests/test_ui_detectors.cpp` with toggles at the top:

```cpp
#define TEST_LOCATE_BOARD         0   // Board localization on itself
#define TEST_DRAW_GRID            0   // Grid drawing utility
#define TEST_YELLOW_SQUARES       0   // Yellow square move extraction (8 images)
#define TEST_PIECE_COUNTS         0   // Piece counting via edge detection (3 images)
#define TEST_RED_SQUARES          0   // Red square detection (2 images)
#define TEST_YELLOW_ARROWS        0   // Yellow arrow detection (2 images)
#define TEST_MISALIGNED_PIECE     0   // Hover box detection (5 images)
#define TEST_GAME_CLOCKS          0   // Clock OCR + active player (3 images)
#define TEST_7_PLIES_EXTRACTION   0   // Full pipeline: 7-ply video vs PGN
#define TEST_MEDIUM_GAME_REVERT   1   // Full pipeline: medium game with revert
#define TEST_CONSTRUCTOR_THROWS   1   // Smoke test: constructor validation
```

Set to `0` to disable. Every test **must** have a toggle — no exceptions.

Integration tests print a summary table after each run, showing test name, video duration, plies extracted, result, processing time, and accuracy across all tests.

## Architecture

The extractor treats the chess.com UI as a deterministic state machine:

1. **Board Localization** — Golden Section Search (O(log N)) across 3 passes: coarse (15 iterations, ¼ res), fine (12 iterations, ¼ res), exact (12 iterations, full res). Total: 39 evaluations vs 67 linear steps before.
2. **Frame Polling** — Sequential 5 FPS forward-only scan via `cap.grab()` (no backward seeks)
3. **Async Frame Prefetching** — Background worker decodes the *next* frame (seek + read + crop + grayscale) while the main thread processes the *current* one
4. **GPU Pipeline** — `GPUPipeline` keeps `prev_gray` and `curr_gray` on GPU. GPU `nppiAbsDiff` + GPU `nppiIntegral` for fast change detection; CPU integral (64F) for accurate move scoring
5. **Square Diffing** — Batch integral image computes all 64 square means simultaneously (no per-ROI `cv::mean` loop)
6. **Legal Move Scoring** — libchess generates legal moves, highest visual diff wins
7. **4-Layer Validation** — Yellow highlights, hover-box rejection, clock turn check, revert detection
8. **Conditional Clock OCR** — Cached clock ROIs; Hu Moments digit recognizer runs in microseconds when pixels change
9. **Move Settling** — Adaptive 0.2s peek-ahead, skipped when confidence >90%
10. **Output** — A PGN file (`<video_name>.pgn`) containing moves, timestamps, and clock data. If Stockfish analysis is enabled, the PGN will also include engine variations and evaluations.
11. **Overlay Templates** — Each queued video carries a selected overlay template. Templates are auto-matched from filename keywords, can be overridden per queue item, and provide independent enable/position/scale settings for the board, eval bar, and PV text.
12. **Video Compositing** — Generates static overlay BMPs combined using FFmpeg `concat` demuxer scripts, dropping overlay render time from minutes to under a second while keeping overlays synchronized with the source video.

Progress is shown as an inline `[XX.X%]` ticker during scanning.

## Performance

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| 7-ply video (18s) | ~5.8s processing (3.0x real-time) |
| Medium game (2m37s, 17 plies) | ~67s processing (2.5x real-time) |
| Board localization | ~2.2s (39 GSS evaluations) |
| Analysis Video Generation | <1s rendering, followed by FFmpeg NVENC stream muxing |
| Unit tests | 9/9 passing |
| Integration tests | 7/7 plies, 17/17 with revert |

## Troubleshooting

### "Error: Could not load board asset at: assets/board/board.png"
The application searches for the `assets/` folder relative to the Current Working Directory. If not found, it intelligently falls back to searching two directories up (`../../assets/`) to support running directly from `build/Release/`. 
If you encounter this error, ensure the `assets/` folder exists at the root of the project and has not been moved.
